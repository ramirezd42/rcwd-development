## About Me

**[Randy Champagne Web Development](http://www.randychampagne.com)**

I am a highly creative full stack developer who creates elegant user-centered experiences for web and mobile. I develop mobile-first responsive web sites and applications for startups, small businesses, and independent professionals.




### Setup

- make sure [node.js](http://nodejs.org) and [roots](http://roots.cx) are installed
- clone this repo down and `cd` into the folder
- run `npm install`
- run `roots watch`




#### optional confgurations to app.cofee

- add this config to 'app.cofee' to enable clean urls
```
  server:
    clean_urls: true
```
- add this config to create project global varibales that can be accessed in any template file
```
 locals:
    developer: 'Randy Champagne'
```
- you can use locals in a jade template like so
```
p this project was developped by #[span= developer]
```
- don't forget to add production 'locals' to 'app.production.cofee'




#### using SASS for css pre-processing

- install accord and node-sass to [enable SASS compilation](https://github.com/jenius/accord/issues/108) ```npm install --save accord node-sass```
- import accord and node-sass in dev and prod app manifest 
```
accord = require 'accord'
sass   = accord.load 'node-sass'
```
- On line 14, change the line that says ```css_pipeline(files: 'assets/css/*.styl')``` to ```css_pipeline(files: 'assets/css/*.scss')```
- At the end of the file tab in once and add the final lines of code:
```
	sass:
		pretty: true
```
- Change .styl files with .scss files. Delete all the files in the 'assets/css' directory of your project. Create a new file in 'assets/css' named 'master.scss'. This file is where you will start creating your sass files.
- Use '.scss' file extension instead of '.sass' for all sass files




#### using browserify for js pre-processing

- install [roots-browserify](https://github.com/carrot/roots-browserify) module 'npm install roots-browserify --save'
- import module into app.cofee ```browserify = require 'roots-browserify'```
- add extension configuration
```
    browserify
      files: 'assets/js/main.coffee'
      out: 'js/build.js'
```




### Deployment

- If you just want to compile the production build, run `roots compile -e production` and it will build to public.
- To deploy your site with a single command, run `roots deploy -to XXX` with `XXX` being whichever [ship](https://github.com/carrot/ship#usage) deployer you want to use.
